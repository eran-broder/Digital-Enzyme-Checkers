# Checkers Game: AI-Generated with a Single Prompt ðŸ§ ðŸŽ®

This simple checkers game was created entirely using the following AI prompt:

```plaintext
let's write a simple checkers game.
i need it to run using html.
i want it saved to c:/t/chekers
use typescript
use npm
keep the game features extremely minimal. just the bare minimum.
do it step by step
small steps  
use subtasks to unburden yourself - but ask for a very detailed response.
minimal functionality as possible
BUT MAKE SURE TO APPLY ALL THE RULES OF THE GAME!    
make sure it works! allow user to move the pieces by clicking on them - then highlight the possible moves - then click on the target square to move the piece.  
let me know when it is compiling, running ok, and the game is ready
```

Every file in this repo (except this README) was generated with this prompt.
